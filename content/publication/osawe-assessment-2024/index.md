abstract: Farmers face increasing pressure to adjust practices to reduce the risk
  of deterioration of water quality. This paper examines the potential of a voluntary,
  confidential, bespoke farm advisory initiative to support water quality improvement
  efforts. Results of a survey of participants in the advisory initiative provide
  some evidence that farmers are willing to adopt advice but the level of stated intention
  to implement recommendations as well as the underlying motivations differ widely
  across specific mitigation measures, which means that while the advisory programme
  has the potential to be successful in reducing water pollution attributable to agriculture,
  it is not certain that the intensity of engagement will be sufficient to ensure
  success.
