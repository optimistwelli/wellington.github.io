 abstract = {Farmers face increasing pressure to adjust practices to reduce the risk of deterioration of water quality. This paper examines the potential of a voluntary, confidential, bespoke farm advisory initiative to support water quality improvement efforts. Results of a survey of participants in the advisory initiative provide some evidence that farmers are willing to adopt advice but the level of stated intention to implement recommendations as well as the underlying motivations differ widely across specific mitigation measures, which means that while the advisory programme has the potential to be successful in reducing water pollution attributable to agriculture, it is not certain that the intensity of engagement will be sufficient to ensure success.},
