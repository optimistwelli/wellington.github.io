abstract: 'Given the significant negative impact of livestock disease outbreaks on
  animal and public health, preventing disease spread through biosecurity practices
  is important. In this study, we used a nationally representative dataset that included
  information on biosecurity practices of almost 300 Irish dairy farmers. We applied
  parametric and nonparametric estimation methods to assess the economic implications
  of adopting the following biosecurity measures: vaccination, bulk tank milk testing
  for diseases, and not pooling colostrum. We found mixed evidence of biosecurity
  practices on economic outcomes, measured as gross margins per cow. Specifically,
  we found that vaccination and testing bulk tank milk for diseases were significantly
  associated with better economic outcomes for dairy farms. However, we found no significant
  association with the economic performance of not pooling colostrum from more than
  one animal. Our findings have important policy implications required for targeting
  support for the adoption of biosecurity practices in dairy herds.'
