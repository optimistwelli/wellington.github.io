abstract: Mitigating the deterioration in water quality is contingent on changing
  human behaviours. Community-based behavioural change initiatives are one approach
  to changing people’s actions, which is distinct from many behavioural change programmes
  that target the actions of in­ dividuals. This paper examines a behavioural change
  initiative aiming to foster proactive com­ munity engagement in the management and
  protection of water catchments in Ireland. The initiative comprises a grant scheme
  for community groups to undertake a variety of activities to support improvements
  in water quality, ranging from education and awareness activities to physical interventions.
  The analysis finds that higher grant awards and a greater number of grant applications
  are positively associated with either a higher likelihood of engagement with public
  and private sector stakeholders or participation in the State’s River Basin Management
  Plan process on improving water quality. While this demonstrates some success for
  the grant scheme, questions remain unanswered with respect to the efficacy of schemes
  like this. With limited quantitative data available both on the precise nature of
  interventions applied and measured target outcomes, it was not possible to discern
  what community group or project attributes are critical to the success of the grant
  scheme. This deficiency means that effectively replicating or scaling up successful
  projects like this will be practically challenging.
