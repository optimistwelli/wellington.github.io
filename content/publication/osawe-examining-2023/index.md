abstract: This paper explores systematic differences in preferences for food products
  labelled with environmental foot­ prints resulting from the production of food.
  Specifically, we use survey data from Irish consumers and explore the relative importance
  of the potential risk to water quality in addition to other environmental attributes
  associated with the production of meat (beef and chicken) and vegetable products
  based on a discrete choice experiment. A Latent Class Model (LCM) is employed to
  identify and distinguish distinct consumer segments as a function of preferences.
  We analyse if personal values and beliefs related to the environmental implications
  of producing food can differentiate preferences for different class segments. Results
  indicate that preferences are heterogeneous across a cohort of consumers. Specifically,
  consumers have a preference for environmental at­ tributes such as carbon and water
  footprints, and potential risk to water quality in food products, with the majority
  of consumers willing to pay a price premium for more environmentally sustainable
  food products.
