abstract: Public acceptance of farming practices relating to animal welfare is becoming
  increasingly important for dairy farmers. In this study, we assess dairy farmers’
  willingness to pay to support a policy aimed at improving calf welfare and link
  this to farmers’ social preferences. We conceptualize the farmer’s decision into
  private reasons and motivations to improve animal welfare or industry reputation.
  Our data come from a survey with over 400 Irish dairy farmers that included an experimental
  component. Specifically, we utilized a contingent valuation referendum method to
  elicit farmers’ willingness to pay. We also used a financially incentivized social
  value orientation scale based on competitive, individualistic, prosocial, and altruistic
  preferences. Our findings indicate that most farmers are supportive of a policy
  scheme to improve animal welfare, and higher social value orientation (i.e. more
  altruistic preferences) is positively associated with higher willingness to pay.
  More detailed analysis suggests that industry concern is associated with more altruistic
  preferences but not concern for animal welfare. Our findings have important policy
  implications as we show that the majority of farmers are willing to financially
  support the implementation of a policy that can help to prevent public bads.
