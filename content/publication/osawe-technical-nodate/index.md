abstract: This study assessed the technical efficiency of fish farmers in Ibadan metropolis
  of Oyo State, Nigeria using the stochastic frontier production function analysis.
  Primary data were collected from 82 fish farmers in Ibadan metropolis. The mean
  efficiency value was 0.906 with majority (65.9 percent) of the fish farmers being
  over 90 percent efficient and about 34.1 percent having technical efficiency ranging
  from 50 to 90 percent. The distribution of results also showed that the fish farmers
  were more efficient in the use of some inputs. Changing the input combinations was
  observed to increase farm level efficiency. The farmers in the study area therefore
  need to use available input intensively and rationally so as to produce better output
  and be more technically efficient.
