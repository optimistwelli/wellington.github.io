	abstract = {Public acceptance of farming practices relating to animal welfare is becoming increasingly important for dairy farmers. In this study, we assess dairy farmers’ willingness to pay to support a policy aimed at improving calf welfare and link this to farmers’ social preferences. We conceptualize the farmer’s decision into private reasons and motivations to improve animal welfare or industry reputation. Our data come from a survey with over 400 Irish dairy farmers that included an experimental component. Specifically, we utilized a contingent valuation referendum method to elicit farmers’ willingness to pay. We also used a financially incentivized social value orientation scale based on competitive, individualistic, prosocial, and altruistic preferences. Our findings indicate that most farmers are supportive of a policy scheme to improve animal welfare, and higher social value orientation (i.e. more altruistic preferences) is positively associated with higher willingness to pay. More detailed analysis suggests that industry concern is associated with more altruistic preferences but not concern for animal welfare. Our findings have important policy implications as we show that the majority of farmers are willing to financially support the implementation of a policy that can help to prevent public bads.},

	abstract = {Given the significant negative impact of livestock disease outbreaks on animal and public health, preventing disease spread through biosecurity practices is important. In this study, we used a nationally representative dataset that included information on biosecurity practices of almost 300 Irish dairy farmers. We applied parametric and nonparametric estimation methods to assess the economic implications of adopting the following biosecurity measures: vaccination, bulk tank milk testing for diseases, and not pooling colostrum. We found mixed evidence of biosecurity practices on economic outcomes, measured as gross margins per cow. Specifically, we found that vaccination and testing bulk tank milk for diseases were significantly associated with better economic outcomes for dairy farms. However, we found no significant association with the economic performance of not pooling colostrum from more than one animal. Our findings have important policy implications required for targeting support for the adoption of biosecurity practices in dairy herds.},

	abstract = {Mitigating the deterioration in water quality is contingent on changing human behaviours. Community-based behavioural change initiatives are one approach to changing people’s actions, which is distinct from many behavioural change programmes that target the actions of in­ dividuals. This paper examines a behavioural change initiative aiming to foster proactive com­ munity engagement in the management and protection of water catchments in Ireland. The initiative comprises a grant scheme for community groups to undertake a variety of activities to support improvements in water quality, ranging from education and awareness activities to physical interventions. The analysis finds that higher grant awards and a greater number of grant applications are positively associated with either a higher likelihood of engagement with public and private sector stakeholders or participation in the State’s River Basin Management Plan process on improving water quality. While this demonstrates some success for the grant scheme, questions remain unanswered with respect to the efficacy of schemes like this. With limited quantitative data available both on the precise nature of interventions applied and measured target outcomes, it was not possible to discern what community group or project attributes are critical to the success of the grant scheme. This deficiency means that effectively replicating or scaling up successful projects like this will be practically challenging.},

Specifically, we use survey data from Irish consumers and explore the relative importance of the potential risk to water quality in addition to other environmental attributes associated with the production of meat (beef and chicken) and vegetable products based on a discrete choice experiment. A Latent Class Model (LCM) is employed to identify and distinguish distinct consumer segments as a function of preferences. We analyse if personal values and beliefs related to the environmental implications of producing food can differentiate preferences for different class segments. Results indicate that preferences are heterogeneous across a cohort of consumers. Specifically, consumers have a preference for environmental at­ tributes such as carbon and water footprints, and potential risk to water quality in food products, with the majority of consumers willing to pay a price premium for more environmentally sustainable food products.},

	volume = {23},
	abstract = {Research on household food demand on a National level have received very little attention and emphasis has been laid on the need to understand the supply side rather than the demand side in the efforts to understand and improve the food security situation in the country. In this study, the demand for food in Nigeria was investigated using 2009 Harmonised National Living Standard Survey (HNLSS) data of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Data on food prices were also obtained from the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).Data from 33,012 households were analysed using a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS). The results showed that the average age of household heads and household size in Nigeria were 47.67years and 4, respectively. Food expenditure share was highest for staples, followed by animal protein, vegetables, fats and fruits. Urban households spend more than twice (N16,430.17) the amount spent by the rural households (N7,077.88) on staples. Key determinants of the demand for any food group in Nigeria were the prices of the food group (except for fruits), the age of household head (except for animal protein), total expenditure on food, number of spouses of household head and marital status of household head (except for fats).Staples and animal protein were normal goods while fats, fruits and vegetables were luxury goods. Staples and animal proteins are demand inelastic while fats, fruits and vegetables are demand elastic. Cross price elasticity results suggest substitutability amongst most of the food groups in the country. To this end, the study suggests the need to implement food policy strategies capable of stimulating demand for food groups such as fruits and vegetables (sources of vitamins and minerals) that can strengthen the immune system and prevent nutrition-related diseases outbreak.},

Results of a survey of participants in the advisory initiative provide some evidence that farmers are willing to adopt advice but the level of stated intention to implement recommendations as well as the underlying motivations differ widely across specific mitigation measures, which means that while the advisory programme has the potential to be successful in reducing water pollution attributable to agriculture, it is not certain that the intensity of engagement will be sufficient to ensure success.},

The distribution of results also showed that the fish farmers were more efficient in the use of some inputs. Changing the input combinations was observed to increase farm level efficiency. The farmers in the study area therefore need to use available input intensively and rationally so as to produce better output and be more technically efficient.},

Using a random effect model in a 2SLS analytical method, results obtained after correcting for endogeneity showed that fertility rate significantly affect infant mortality rate in a positive way. Similarly, GDP per capita as a proxy for income, public health expenditure as a percentage of GDP, Prevalence of HIV and the participation of adult female in the labour force significantly affect infant mortality rate. Furthermore, of all the explanatory variables used in the analysis, fertility rate and GDP per capita had the most impact on infant mortality rate respectively. This study also confirms Chowdhury’s (1988) postulation that there is a dual causality between infant mortality rate and fertility rate.},
